Things we've done to get this running on Windows10:

- Use anaconda prompt to conda install tensorflow. No other command prompt could
find the library.

- Install librosa on your conda environment using the conda command given
in the librosa readme:  https://github.com/librosa/librosa
This prevents a weird audioread error.
