Final project for Computers, Sound, & Music at Portland State University.

###Project Setup
This project should be run in an Anaconda virtual environment.
Once inside the virtual environment, run the following commands:

```conda install tensorflow```

```conda install -c conda-forge librosa```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This should get the environment set up properly for running the code


###Data Preprocessing

Should you want to re-run the preprocessing, you will need to download the nsynth dataset
and put the files into the workspace. We chose to handle the files manually because accessing
the dataset through tensorflow was too time-heavy for our machines.
